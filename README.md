# AMD-OSX-EFIs
 
**So What is this???**

These came from the *HighSierraAMDUnofficialV3* Distros of AMD OSX that used to be used. This is no longer the case, as this approach is very messy, doesn't work a lot of the time, and replacing the kernel also rips away iServices support. In other words, *don't use this method!*

**Do Not use this EFI folders!** They are extremely outdated, useless, they are only here for historical purposes.
